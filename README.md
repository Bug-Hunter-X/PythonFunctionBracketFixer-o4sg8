# Unclosed Bracket Bug in Python

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Python involving a missing closing bracket in a function definition.  The error doesn't immediately trigger a syntax error, making it harder to detect.

## The Bug

The `bug.py` file contains a function with an unclosed bracket. This leads to unexpected behavior when the function is executed.  The interpreter may throw an IndentationError or, more insidiously, it may execute some code and then terminate unexpectedly due to unexpected scoping.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.py` file provides the corrected code with the missing bracket added. This fixes the unexpected behavior and makes the code work as intended.

## How to reproduce the error

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `bug.py` file.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior or error.
4. Run the `bugSolution.py` file.
5. Observe the correct output.
